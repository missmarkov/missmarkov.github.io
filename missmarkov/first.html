            <article>
                <p>
                    Not feeling very inspirative today, but I'll give it a try.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other day, I ran across a question: how do you, who made someone never believe anyone else again, sleep at night?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember the time when you could give yourself the luxury of being naive?
                    Do you remember the time when it stopped?
                    Do you miss it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thought so. Everyone used to talk about loosing your inocence, meaning only the phisical way, when the more important one was just this.
                    At some point, someone made you feel bad about yourself. Someone hurt you, someone might have betrayed you.
                    Hell, somebody might have even destroyed you and left you in pieces, without ever looking back.                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those images might still even be in your head and from time to time, you probably still have nightmares or bad dreams.
                    Where am I going with this?
                    Day by day, we are constantly overflown with images of perfect people, perfect places, perfect food, captions, dream works and incredible life stories.
                    It seems as if no one talks about their own lives, or the bad things anymore.
                    What if I want to? What if you need to?
                </p>
